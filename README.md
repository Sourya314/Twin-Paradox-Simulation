# Twin-Paradox-Simulation
# Twin Paradox Simulation — Sourya & Mourya

🌀 A Python simulation of the famous Twin Paradox using **special relativity**.

This project models two twins:
- **Sourya**: stays on Earth
- **Mourya**: travels at near-light speed

Due to time dilation, Mourya experiences less time than Sourya — a core prediction of Einstein’s theory.

## 📊 Features

- Animated graph showing:
  - Mourya’s time vs velocity
  - Age difference between the twins
- Uses `matplotlib.animation` for visualization
- Based on pure special relativity (no gravity)
